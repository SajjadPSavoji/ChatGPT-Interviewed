### 1. What is the difference between stemming and lemmatization? [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)

Stemming and lemmatization are both techniques used in natural language processing to reduce words to their base form. The main difference between the two is that stemming is a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words, while lemmatization is a more sophisticated process that uses vocabulary and morphological analysis to determine the base form of a word. Lemmatization is more accurate but also more computationally expensive.

Example: The word "better"
* Stemming: The stem of the word "better" is likely to be "better" (e.g. by using Porter stemmer)
* Lemmatization: The base form of the word "better" is "good" (e.g. by using WordNetLemmatizer with POS tagger)

### 2. What do you know about Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)? [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a technique used in NLP and information retrieval to extract the underlying meaning or concepts from a collection of text documents. LSI uses mathematical techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns and relationships in the co-occurrence of words within a corpus of text. LSI is based on the idea that words that are used in similar context tend to have similar meanings. 

### 3. What do you know about Dependency Parsing? [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
Dependency parsing is a technique used in natural language processing to analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence, and to identify the relationships between its words. It is used to build a directed graph where words are represented as nodes, and grammatical relationships between words are represented as edges. Each node has one parent and can have multiple children, representing the grammatical relations between the words.

There are different algorithms for dependency parsing, such as the Earley parser, the CYK parser, and the shift-reduce parser. 

### 4. Name different approaches for text summarization. [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
There are several different approaches to text summarization, including:
* Extractive summarization: Selects the most important sentences or phrases from the original text.
* Abstractive summarization: Generates new sentences that capture the key concepts and themes of the original text.
* Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) based summarization: Uses LSA to identify the key concepts in a text.
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based summarization: Uses LDA to identify the topics in a text.
* Neural-based summarization: Uses deep neural networks to generate a summary.

Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses and the choice of the approach will depend on the specific use case and the quality of the summary desired.

### 5. What approach would you use for part of speech tagging? [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
There are a few different approaches that can be used for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, such as:
* Rule-based tagging: using pre-defined rules to tag text
* Statistical tagging: using statistical models to tag text
* Hybrid tagging: Combining rule-based and statistical methods
* Neural-based tagging: using deep neural networks to tag text

### 6. Explain what is a n-gram model. [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
An n-gram model is a type of statistical language model used in NLP. It is based on the idea that the probability of a word in a sentence is dependent on the probability of the n-1 preceding words, where n is the number of words in the gram.

The model represents the text as a sequence of n-grams, where each n-gram is a sequence of n words. The model uses the frequency of each n-gram in a large corpus of text to estimate the probability of each word in a sentence, based on the n-1 preceding words.

### 7. Explain how TF-IDF measures word importance. [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document or collection of documents. It is calculated as the product of the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF) of a word.

The term frequency (TF) of a word is the number of times the word appears in a document, normalized by the total number of words in the document.

The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a word is the logarithm of the total number of documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents in which the word appears.


### 8. What is perplexity used for? [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
Perplexity is a statistical measure used to evaluate the quality of a probability model, particularly language models. It is used to quantify the uncertainty of a model when predicting the next word in a sequence of words. The lower the perplexity, the better the model is at predicting the sequence of words. 

Sure, here's the formula for perplexity in LaTeX format:

Perplexity = $2^{H(D)}$

$H(D) = - \frac{1}{N} {\sum}_{i=1}^{N} {log_2^{ P(w_i) }}$

$w_i$ = the i-th word in the sequence

$N$ = the number of words in the sequence

$P(w_i)$ = the probability of the i-th word according to the model

### 9. What is Bag-of-Worrds model? [[src]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/nlp-interview-questions-and-answers/439)
The bag-of-words model is a representation of text data where a text is represented as a bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of the frequency of each word. It is simple to implement and computationally efficient, but it discards grammatical information and word order, which can be important for some NLP tasks.
